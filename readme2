1) I have used nodejs and mongodb as the backend technologies.
2) Do extract the zip, do 'npm install' for installing all the required packages, do 'ng serve' for executing the project and do 'npm run start:server' for starting the nodemon
3) I have used mongodb atlas (cloud) for storage purposes and its uri is "mongodb+srv://aneesh:aneesh@cluster0.9mm3n.mongodb.net/vitasoft?retryWrites=true&w=majority". I whitelisted all ipadresses so that any user can acess it.
4) Vistasoft is the db name, logins and students are the collections where required details are stored according to the type of collection
5) Main operations are: Register, Login, Storing the User details and deletion. All these operation are performed through REST API
6) As always a demo video is attached for reference.
